                <h1>The Life of Katherine Johnson</h1>
                <p>
                    Mathematician Katherine Johnson, a woman who broke racial and gender barriers at NASA, has died at the age of 101. She is best known for her work as a “human computer” that helped make early human space flight possible. Johnson’s achievements include calculating—with a pencil and a slide rule—the precise paths to allow Apollo 11 to land on the moon in <strong>1969</strong> and, later, have it safely return to Earth.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>She was born in <strong>1918</strong> in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.</li>
                    <li>She entered high school at age 10 and graduated at 14, promptly enrolling in college the next year.</li>
                    <li>By the time Johnson was a junior in college, she had taken all of the math classes they offered. She had a mentor at school named William Waldron Schieffelin Claytor who was only the third black person to receive a doctorate in mathematics from an American university. </li>
                    <li>Johnson graduated in <strong>1937</strong> with a double major in mathematics and French.</li>
                    <li>After graduating, Johnson took a job as a school teacher and got married.</li>
                    <li>In <strong>1940</strong>, she had the chance to return to school by being one of three black graduate students to integrate into West Virginia University. She withdrew from her schooling, however, when she found out she was pregnant with her first child. For more than 10 years after that, her life was focused on her family and career as a teacher.</li>
                    <li>In <strong>1952</strong>, she heard that NASA’s Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory was hiring black women. She began working there in <strong>1953.</strong></li>
                    <li>Two weeks into her job, she helped calculate aerodynamic forces on airplanes.</li>
                    <li>In addition to Apollo 11, she helped calculate the launch window for the Mercury mission in <strong>1961</strong>, which was American’s first human spaceflight.</li>
                    <li>After retiring from NASA in <strong>1986</strong>, Johnson became an advocate for mathematics education in public schools.</li>
                </ul>
