                    All developers will use some kind of version control system (VCS), a tool to allow them to collaborate with other developers on a project without danger of them overwriting each other's work, and roll back to previous versions of the code base if a problem is discovered later on. The most popular VCS (at least among web developers) is Git, along with GitHub, a site that provides hosting for your repositories and several tools for working with them. This module aims to teach you what you need to know about both of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    VCSes are essential for software development:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is rare that you will work on a project completely on your own, and as soon as you start working with other people you start to run the risk of conflicting with each other's work — this is when both of you try to update the same piece of code at the same time. You need to have some kind of mechanism in place to manage the occurences, and help avoid loss of work as a result</li>
                    <li>When working on a project on your own or with others, you'll want to be able to back up the code in a central place, so it is not lost if your computer breaks</li>
                    <li>You will also want to be able to roll back to earlier versions if a problem is later discovered. You might have started doing this in your own work by creating different versions of the same file, e.g. <code>myCode.js</code>, <code>myCode_v2.js</code>, <code>myCode_v3.js</code>, <code>myCode_final.js</code>, <code>myCode_really_really_final.js</code>, etc., but this is really error-prone and unreliable.</li>
                    <li>Different team members will commonly want to create their own separate versions of the code (called <b>branches</b> in Git), work on a new feature in that version, and then get it merged in a controlled manner (in GitHub we use <b>pull requests</b>) with the master version when they are done with it.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    VCSes provide tools to meet the above needs. Git is an example of a VCS, and GitHub is a web site + infrastructure that provides a Git server plus a number of really useful tools for working with git repositories individually or in teams, such as reporting issues with the code, reviewing tools, project management features such as assigning tasks and task statuses, and more.

            <article>
                <p>
                    To use Git and GitHub, you need:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A desktop computer with Git installed on it (see the <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git downloads page)</a>.</li>
                    <li>A tool to use Git. Depending on how you like to work, you could use a <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis/">Git GUI client</a> (we'd recommend GitHub Desktop, SourceTree or Git Kraken) or just stick to using a terminal window. In fact, it is probably useful for you to get to know at least the basics of git terminal commands, even if you intend to use a GUI.</li>
                    <li>A <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</a>. If you haven't already got one, sign up now using the provided link.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In terms of prerequisite knowledge, you don't need to know anything about web development, Git/GitHub or VCSes to start this module. However, it is recommended that you know some coding so that you have reasonable computer literacy, and some code to store in your repositories!
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is also preferrable that you have some basic terminal knowledge, so for example moving between directories, creating files, and modifying the system <code>PATH</code>.

                Create a Repository

                <p>
                    A <b>repository</b> is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a <em>README</em>, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. <em>It also offers other common options such as a license file.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your <code>hello-world</code> repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
                </p>
                <h3>To create a new repository</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click + and then select New repository.</li>
                    <li>Name your repository <code>hello-world</code>.</li>
                    <li>Write a short description.</li>
                    <li>Select <b>Initialize this repository with a README</b>.</li>
                </ol>

            <article>
                <p>
                    <b>Branching</b> is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default your repository has one branch named main which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to <code>main</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you create a branch off the <code>main</code> branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of <code>main</code> as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the <code>main</code> branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This diagram shows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>main</code> branch</li>
                    <li>A new branch called <code>feature</code> (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)</li>
                    <li>The journey that <code>feature</code> takes before it’s merged into <code>main</code></li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                <img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png" alt="image of branching">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>story.txt</code></li>
                    <li><code>story-joe-edit.txt</code></li>
                    <li><code>story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our <code>main</code> (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into <code>main</code>.
                </p>
                <h3>To create a new branch</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to your new repository <code>hello-world</code>.</li>
                    <li>Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says <b>branch: main</b>.</li>
                    <li>Type a branch name, <code>readme-edits</code>, into the new branch text box.</li>
                    <li>Select the blue <b>Create branch</b> box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.</li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                <img class="branch-img" src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/readme-edits.gif" alt="how to create a new branch">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Now you have two branches, <code>Main</code> and <code>readme-edits</code>. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.
                </p>

                Make a Commit
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Bravo! Now, you’re on the code view for your <code>readme-edits</code> branch, which is a copy of <code>main</code>. Let’s make some edits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On GitHub, saved changes are called <em>commits</em>. Each commit has an associated <em>commit message</em>, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
                </p>
                <h3>Make and commit changes</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click the <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
                    <li>Click the  pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.</li>
                    <li>In the editor, write a bit about yourself.</li>
                    <li>Write a commit message that describes your changes.</li>
                    <li>Click <b>Commit changes</b> button.</li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                <img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/commit.png" alt="how to make and commit changes">
                </div>
                <p>
                    These changes will be made to just the README file on your <code>readme-edits branch</code>, so now this branch contains content that’s different from <code>main</code>.
                </p>
            <article>

        <section id="Open_a_Pull_Request" class="main-section">
            <header>
                Open a Pull Request
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of <code>main</code>, you can open a <em>pull request</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a <em>pull request</em>, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show <em>diffs</em>, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red. <br> As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using GitHub’s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/#text-formatting-toolbar">@mention system</a> in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects
